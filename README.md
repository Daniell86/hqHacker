This is a bot that I made to solve Hq trivia questions. This is purely for educational
purposes and is not intended to be used to cheat the game. It uses the tesseract Api to read the questions off screen
then will perform some language analysis using the textRazor Api and google wht it thinks will return the most likely answer.
